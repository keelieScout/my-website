        <h1>What are ACEs?</h1>
        <p>“ACEs” is an acronym for Adverse Childhood Experiences. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are traumatic events that occur between ages 1 and 17. These experiences can have lasting effects on a person’s health, often contributing to mental health challenges, chronic physical conditions, and substance use disorders. However, with proper care and support, many of these conditions can be effectively treated or managed throughout life.</p>
