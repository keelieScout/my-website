    <h2>The ACE Study</h2>
    <p>"The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study reveals the profound impact of childhood trauma on lifelong health. This research shows that childhood abuse and household dysfunction are both widespread and strongly linked to many leading causes of death, including heart disease, cancer, stroke, depression, and addiction. By highlighting how early trauma can contribute to serious health issues, the ACE Study emphasizes the need to address and prevent childhood abuse for a healthier society." - Dr. Vincent Felitti</p>

    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>The topic I have chosen is from my LBED 2300 class about the core brain story. This topic interests me because it highlights the long-term effects of 
        childhood trauma on mental and physical health. Understanding ACES can lead to better 
        support systems and interventions, and it resonates with my passion for mental health 
        awareness</p>
